<p>John Von Neumann, who was born on December 28th, 1903, in Budapest, contributed very much to the realm of Mathematics, Physics, Computing, and many other fields. Before his death in 1957, 
aged 53, he had helped with the maths behind hydrogen bombs by using computing. He and Stanislaw Ulam used computers to run many simulations for the hydrodynamic computations required for
 to further the research and possibility of a hydrogen bomb. During this time, he had also helped with the increase of computing power with the EDVAC and ENIAC systems.
